# Generic functions and methods for computing score and Hessian

The generic functions `score` and `hessian` along with the corresponding
methods for distribution objects enable the computation of the score
(first derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameters)
and Hessian (corresponding second derivative).

## Usage

``` r
score(d, ...)

hessian(d, ...)

# S3 method for class 'distribution'
score(d, x, which = NULL, drop = TRUE, eps = .Machine$double.eps^(1/3), ...)

# S3 method for class 'distribution'
hessian(
  d,
  x,
  which = NULL,
  drop = TRUE,
  expected = FALSE,
  eps = .Machine$double.eps^(1/4),
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- d:

  An object, typically a distribution object, e.g., as created by
  [`Normal()`](https://zeileis.github.io/distributions3/dev/reference/Normal.md)
  or
  [`Binomial()`](https://zeileis.github.io/distributions3/dev/reference/Binomial.md).

- x:

  A vector of elements whose score/Hessian should be determined given
  the distribution `d`. Either `d` and `x` need to have the same length
  or length 1.

- which:

  character or `NULL` (default). Character labels for the derivatives to
  be included in the score or Hessian respectively. In `score` the
  possible values are (combinations of) the parameter names (e.g.,
  `"mu"` and/or `"sigma"`). In `hessian` additionally the
  cross-derivatives (e.g., `mu:sigma` and `sigma:mu`) are available. By
  default (if `which = NULL`) all elements of the score or Hessian
  should be computed.

- drop:

  logical. Should the result be simplified to a vector if possible?

- ...:

  Arguments passed to methods.

- expected:

  logical. Should the expected Hessian be computed? If `FALSE` the
  observed Hessian is computed. Some methods might only support only one
  or the the other option and defaults might differ.

- eps:

  numeric. Tolerance when obtaining the score or Hessian via numeric
  differentiation.

## Value

Either a numeric matrix with suitable column names is returned or a
numeric vector (provided that `which` has length 1 and `drop = TRUE`).

## Details

In the methods for dedicated distributions analytical results for
computing the score or Hessian should be used. All `hessian` methods
should implemented the `expected` argument with an appropriate default.
If a `hessian` method only supports the expected or the observed
Hessian, then an error should be issued if needed.

In the fallback methods for general `distribution` objects a simple
differencing approach is used. Either differences of `log_pdf` (for the
`score`) or of `score` (for the `hessian`) with slightly modified
parameters are used. If the parameters in a distribution are on the
boundary of the parameter space this might lead to errors in the
computation.

## Examples

``` r
X <- Normal(mu = c(0, 1, 2), sigma = c(2, 1, 1))
x <- c(0, 0, 1)
score(X, x)
#>      mu sigma
#> [1,]  0  -0.5
#> [2,] -1   0.0
#> [3,] -1   0.0
hessian(X, x)
#>         mu sigma:mu mu:sigma sigma
#> [1,] -0.25        0        0  0.25
#> [2,] -1.00        2        2 -2.00
#> [3,] -1.00        2        2 -2.00
hessian(X, x, expected = TRUE)
#>         mu sigma:mu mu:sigma sigma
#> [1,] -0.25        0        0  -0.5
#> [2,] -1.00        0        0  -2.0
#> [3,] -1.00        0        0  -2.0

h <- hessian(X[1], x[1], expected = TRUE)
matrix(h, ncol = 2, dimnames = list(c("mu", "sigma"), c("mu", "sigma")))
#>          mu sigma
#> mu    -0.25   0.0
#> sigma  0.00  -0.5
