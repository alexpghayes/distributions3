<!-- badges: end -->

`distributions3`, inspired by the [eponynmous Julia
package](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl), provides a
generic function interface to probability distributions.
`distributions3` has two goals:

1.  Replace the `rnorm()`, `pnorm()`, etc, family of functions with S3
    methods for distribution objects

2.  Be extremely well documented and friendly for students in intro stat
    classes.

The main generics are:

-   `random()`: Draw samples from a distribution.
-   `pdf()`: Evaluate the probability density (or mass) at a point.
-   `cdf()`: Evaluate the cumulative probability up to a point.
-   `quantile()`: Determine the quantile for a given probability.
    Inverse of `cdf()`.

## Installation

You can install `distributions3` with:

``` r
install.packages("distributions3")
```

You can install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexpghayes/distributions3")
```

## Basic Usage

The basic usage of `distributions3` looks like:

``` r
library("distributions3")

X <- Bernoulli(0.1)

random(X, 10)
#>  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
pdf(X, 1)
#> [1] 0.1

cdf(X, 0)
#> [1] 0.9
quantile(X, 0.5)
#> [1] 0
```

Note that `quantile()` **always** returns lower tail probabilities. If
you arenâ€™t sure what this means, please read the last several paragraphs
of `vignette("one-sample-z-confidence-interval")` and have a gander at
the plot.

## Related work

For a comprehensive overview of the many packages providing various
distribution related functionality see the [CRAN Task
View](https://cran.r-project.org/view=Distributions).

-   [`distributional`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distributional)
    provides distribution objects as vectorized S3 objects
-   [`distr6`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distr6) builds on
    `distr`, but uses R6 objects
-   [`distr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distr) is quite similar
    to `distributions`, but uses S4 objects and is less focused on
    documentation.
-   [`fitdistrplus`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitdistrplus)
    provides extensive functionality for fitting various distributions
    but does not treat distributions themselves as objects
