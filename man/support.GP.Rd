\item{drop}{logical. Should the result be simplified to a vector if possible?}

\item{...}{Currently not used.}
}
\value{
In case of a single distribution object, a numeric vector of length 2
with the minimum and maximum value of the support (if \code{drop = TRUE}, default)
or a \code{matrix} with 2 columns. In case of a vectorized distribution object, a
matrix with 2 columns containing all minima and maxima.
