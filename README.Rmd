`distributions3`, inspired by the [eponynmous Julia package](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl), provides a generic function interface to probability distributions. `distributions3` has two goals:

1. Replace the `rnorm()`, `pnorm()`, etc, family of functions with S3 methods for distribution objects

2. Be extremely well documented and friendly for students in intro stat classes.

The main generics are:

- `random()`: Draw samples from a distribution.
- `pdf()`: Evaluate the probability density (or mass) at a point.
- `cdf()`: Evaluate the cumulative probability up to a point.
- `quantile()`: Determine the quantile for a given probability. Inverse of `cdf()`.

## Installation

You can install `distributions3` with:

``` r
install.packages("distributions3")
```

You can install the development version with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alexpghayes/distributions3")
```

## Basic Usage

The basic usage of `distributions3` looks like:

```{r}
library("distributions3")

X <- Bernoulli(0.1)

random(X, 10)
pdf(X, 1)

cdf(X, 0)
quantile(X, 0.5)
```

Note that `quantile()` **always** returns lower tail probabilities. If you aren't sure what this means, please read the last several paragraphs of `vignette("one-sample-z-confidence-interval")` and have a gander at the plot.

## Related work

For a comprehensive overview of the many packages providing various distribution related functionality see the [CRAN Task View](https://cran.r-project.org/view=Distributions).

- [`distributional`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distributional) provides distribution objects as vectorized S3 objects
- [`distr6`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distr6) builds on `distr`, but uses R6 objects
- [`distr`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=distr) is quite similar to `distributions`, but uses S4 objects and is less focused on documentation. 
- [`fitdistrplus`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=fitdistrplus) provides extensive functionality for fitting various distributions but does not treat distributions themselves as objects
